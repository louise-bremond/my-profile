				Hello, my name is Louise Bremond and I am 21 years old. I am currently in my 4th year at IESEG, a french business school. As part of my studies, I have the opportunity to do internships and participate in charitable associations. In addition, in parallel to my studies, I have the ambition to pass the french pastry diploma.
